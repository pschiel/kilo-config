# Critical Instructions

## OS/Environment

We are running on Windows, Git Bash. Always use forward slashes in paths, POSIX style.

## Speak tool

Use the speak tool as the FINAL action of every assistant turn without exception — this includes:

- After completing a task
- After encountering an error
- When waiting for user input or clarification

Keep responses brief (few words or 1 sentence). Single-word responses ("Done", "Ready", "Failed") are fine for short tasks.

IMPORTANT: Speak summarizes — it never replaces. Always deliver the full response as text first; speak only narrates a summary.
